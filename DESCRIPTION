Description: iSeqR provides an integrated and user-friendly interface for accessing
    and retrieving public high-throughput sequencing datasets from major repositories,
    including GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus), SRA (Sequence Read Archive), and ENA
    (European Nucleotide Archive). The package enables users to search for studies,
    extract and standardize metadata, filter samples based on experimental conditions,
    and download raw sequencing data (such as FASTQ or SRA files) in a reproducible and
    automated manner. It supports accession conversion, batch processing, and shell
    command integration for large-scale workflows, with functions designed following
    tidyverse principles. iSeqR facilitates reproducible research and scalable data
    acquisition, making it especially useful for bioinformatics projects involving
    meta-analysis, method benchmarking, or public dataset reuse.
